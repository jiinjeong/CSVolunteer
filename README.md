### Week 1-5: Python Beginner
#### Week 1: Introduction to CS (@jiinjeong)
* **What is Python?**: A programming language is a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. There are many programming languages including Java, C, C++, Ruby, etc. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created in 1991 by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. The current stable release is version 3.8, so we typically say we are using Python3.
* **REPL**: [REPL](repl.it) is an online-based text editor. Advantage is that it supports many programming languages and that you don't need to download anything to run the program.
* **Print**: Prints a message to the screen.
```python
    print("Hello world")
```
* **Data types**: Tells the computer how the programmer intends to use the data. There are four primitive data types in Python: string (str), integer (int), floating-point numbers (float), and booleans (bool).
  * Strings are sequences of characters. They are in single-quotes ('') or double-quotes (""). For example, "Hello", "123", and "abc."
  * Integers are numeric values without decimals, such as 0, 2, 10.
  * Floats are more complex numeric values with decimals, such as 0.001, 0.5, 0.2.
  * Booleans are True/False.
  * We can check with `type()`.
```python
    print(type("Hamilton College"))
    print(type(10))
    print(type(0.11))
    print(type(True))
```
* **When to use what?**:
  * Name --> String
  * Address --> String
  * License Plate --> String (although it contains numeric values)
  * Number of pets --> Integer (you can't have 2.2 dogs)
  * Zipcode --> Integer
  * Bank balance --> Float
  * Height/Weight --> Float
  * Marital status --> Bool (True/False)
  * Shipment status --> Bool (True/False)
* **Comment**: To make single-line comments, you use a hashtag (#). Multiline comments are in three double-quotes (""" """). Computer will not execute comments. They are useful as they can explain to you/other programmers what your code does.
```python
   # This is a single-line comment.
   """
     This is a multi-line
     comment that can span over
     multiple lines.
   """
```
* **Variable**: Stores a value; can be changed (contrast with constant).
```python
    var_name = value    # The value can be of any data type (str/int/float/bool)
    # 1. Use a descriptive name
    something = "USA"   # X
    country = "USA"     # O
    # 2. Instead of spaces, use underscore (_)
    first name = "Jiin" # X
    first_name = "Jiin" # O
    # 3. Can't start with a number
    1score = 100        # X
    score1 = 100        # O
    # 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (Name and name are different). Usually, we should start with a lowercase.
    Is_student = False  # O
    is_student = False  # O
```
* **Input**: Allows user input, adding interactivity to your program.
* **String Concatenation**: Strings can be added with +.
```python
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print("Hello " + name)
```
* **Function**: Block of code that is only run when called. Functions are useful for code organization and reusability. Analogy: You can think of a function as a "file" for your code. You create a file with content that serve a purpose. To access a file, you have to open the file (=call the file).
```python
# Defining a function
def func_name():
    print("Hello)"  # Anything inside the function, indent with four spaces.
# Calling a function
func_name()
```
Actual example:
```python
# Defining a function
def greet():
    print("Hello)"  # Anything inside the function, indent with four spaces.
# Calling a function
greet()
```
* **Main function**: Acts as the starting point of execution for the code.
```python
def main():
    greet()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Week 4: List, Indexing, and Random Library
* **What is a list?**
    * A list of objects— can be strings, integers, Booleans, floats, anything. Elements of a list can even be lists themselves.
    * A list is surrounded by square brackets, and objects are separated by a comma
    * Can be changed/modified
```python3
newList = [7, ‘a’, False, 4.2]
pyList = list(‘python’)		# pyList = [‘p’, ‘y’, ‘t’, ‘h’, ‘o’, ‘n’]
```    
* Lists are their own type, just like str or int:
```python3
print(type(newList))	# Prints: <class ‘list’>
```
* **Indexing**
* Each element in a list is assigned an index, starting at 0 (not 1!). Each element can be accessed through its index:
```python3
newList = [7, ‘a’, False, 4.2, 13]
print(newList[0])	# Prints: 7
print(newList[1])	# Prints: a
print(newList[5])	# IndexError: list index out of range
```
* Each element can also be accessed through reverse indexing, where the last element in the list has the index -1, the second-to-last has index -2, and so on:
```python3
newList = [7, ‘a’, False, 4.2, 13]
print(newList[-1])	# Prints: 13
print(newList[-3])	# Prints: False
```
* List indexing can also be used to slice certain pieces of lists. In square brackets, the first number is the starting point of the slice (inclusive) and the second number is the ending point of the slice (exclusive). If there is a third number, it is the number to skip-count by (for example, 2 means every other, 3 means every third, and -1 means every element working backwards). See examples below:
```python3
numList = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
a = numList[3:8]	# a = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
b = numList[1:9:2]	# b = [4, 6, 8, 10]
```
* If no start point is specified, the slice starts from the beginning, and if no endpoint is specified, the slice goes to the end.
```python3
numList = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
c = numList[5:]	# c = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
d = numList[::-1]	# d = [13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
```
* All of these indexing rules can be used with strings, as well.
```python3
string = ‘Hello, world!’
e = string[5]		# e = ‘,’
f = string[1:11:2]	# f = ‘el,wr’
```
* The list class comes with many different methods that are useful for changing or finding out characteristics of lists. There are too many to list here, but these are a few of the most useful. The rest can be found with a google search.
    * len(list name)	—returns number of elements in list
	* list name.append(single element to add to end of list)
	* list name.extend(list to add to end of list)
	* list name.sort(key to sort by—if no key is specified, sorts numerically/alphabetically)
	* Other methods can filter, add/remove specific elements at specific indices, count number of times an element appears in a list, etc. Just google Python List Methods!

### Week 1-5: Python Intermediate
#### Week 1: Loop 1: "For" loop
* **What is a `for` loop?**: `for` loops are used to iterate over sequences. Sequences that we have seen are lists and strings. Other iterable sequences include dictionaries, sets, and tuples. `for` loops execute a set of statements for each element in the sequence.
```python
  for var in sequence:
    print("Do something.")
```
* **The Range Function**: The `range(start, end, step)` function returns a sequence of numbers. `for` loops utilize the `range()` function to generate a new iterable sequence in the given range.
```python
  # 1. Prints values from 0 to 6 (not including 6)
  for i in range(6): # range(6) = (0 1 2 3 4 5)
    print(i)
  # 2. Prints values from 2 to 6 (not including 6)
  for i in range(2, 6): # range(2, 5) = (2 3 4 5)
    print(i)
  # 3. Prints values from 0 to 6, stepping by 2 (not including 6)
  for i in range(0, 6, 2): # range(0, 6, 2) = (0 2 4)
    print(i)
```
* **Looping Through a List**: With a `for` loop, you can execute a set of statements for each element of the list.
```python
  # prints each string color in the list colors
  colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']
  for color in colors:
    print(color)
```
* **Looping Over a String**: Looping over a string behaves similarly to a looping on a list, you can execute a set of statements for each character in the string.
```python
  # prints each character in "Hello!"
  greeting = "Hello!"
  for character in greeting:
    print(character)
```

* **Applications for Loops**:
```python
  # 1. Calculate the sum of the number in the range(1, 6)
  sum = 0
  for i in range(1, 6):
    sum += i  # sum += i is equivalent to sum = sum + i
  # 2. Generates a list of lengths of each string in words
  words = ["computer", "science", "is", "fun"]
  word_lengths = []
  for word in words:
    length_word = length(word)
    word_lengths.append(length_word)
  # 3. Generates new phrase with '!' instead of '.'
  phrase = "Hello. My name is Ruby. What's yours?"
  happy_phrase = ""
  for character in phrase:
    if character == '.':
      happy_phrase += '!'
    else:
      happy_phrase += character
```

#### Week 2: Loop 2: While loop
* **What is a `while` loop?**: `while` loops repeatedly execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Recall that a condition is a statement that evaluates to boolean type.
```python
  while condition:
    print("Do something.")
```
* **Example**: Before the body of the `while` loop executes, the condition is re-evaluated. In the example below, the condition is `counter < 10`. If the condition evaluates to true, the body is executed. Otherwise, `counter = 10` and the body does not execute.
```python
  # prints values 0 to 9
  counter = 0
  while counter < 10:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```
* **Indefinite `while` Loops**: `while` loops are indefinetly iterable. In the example below, the `while` loop executes an indefinte number of times, until the user inputs the the terminating word and the 'while' condition evaluates to false.
```python
  # echos user input until terminator keyword 'exit' is entered
  terminator = "exit"
  word = input("What is your word? (type 'exit' to end): ")
  while word != terminator:
    print("Did you say " + word + "?")
    word = input("What is your word? (type 'exit' to end): ")
```
* **Infinite `while` Loops**: Warning! `while` loops can be infinite if the condition never evaluates to false. In the example below, `i` is never modified and therefore the loop never exits. In the next section, you will learn to how to break a loop without the condition evaluating to false.
```python
  # prints forever and ever and ever ... forever
  print("I will go on forever... ")
  i = 0
  while i == 0:
    print("and ever... ")
```
